################### Filebeat Configuration Example #########################

############################# Filebeat ######################################
filebeat:
  # List of prospectors to fetch data.
  prospectors:
    # Each - is a prospector. Below are the prospector specific configurations   
    -
      # Configuration to use stdin input
      input_type: log
      # Set log file path
      paths:
        - /var/log/fiona/fiona.log

      # Set the document type
      document_type: syslog

    # if there are more than one log file:
    # Additional prospector
    -
      # Configuration to use stdin input
      #input_type: log

      #paths:
      #  - /var/log/APP-LOG2.log

      #document_type: syslog

  # General filebeat configuration options
  #
  # Event count spool threshold - forces network flush if exceeded
  #spool_size: 2048

  # Defines how often the spooler is flushed. After idle_timeout the spooler is
  # Flush even though spool_size is not reached.
  #idle_timeout: 5s

  # Name of the registry file. Per default it is put in the current working
  # directory. In case the working directory is changed after when running
  # filebeat again, indexing starts from the beginning again.
  # registry_file: /var/lib/filebeat/registry

  # Full Path to directory with additional prospector configuration files. Each file must end with .yml
  # These config files must have the full filebeat config part inside, but only
  # the prospector part is processed. All global options like spool_size are ignored.
  # The config_dir MUST point to a different directory then where the main filebeat config file is in.
  #config_dir:

###############################################################################
############################# Libbeat Config ##################################
# Base config file used by all other beats for using libbeat features

############################# Output ##########################################

# Configure what outputs to use when sending the data collected by the beat.
# Multiple outputs may be used.
output: 
  ### Logstash as output
  logstash:
    # The Logstash hosts
    hosts: ["10.100.90.2:5044"]


############################# Shipper #########################################

shipper:
  # The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
  # all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
  # If this options is not defined, the hostname is used.
  #name:

  # The tags of the shipper are included in their own field with each
  # transaction published. Tags make it easy to group servers by different
  # logical properties.
  #tags: ["service-X", "web-tier"]

  # Uncomment the following if you want to ignore transactions created
  # by the server on which the shipper is installed. This option is useful
  # to remove duplicates if shippers are installed on multiple servers.
  #ignore_outgoing: true

  # How often (in seconds) shippers are publishing their IPs to the topology map.
  # The default is 10 seconds.
  #refresh_topology_freq: 10

  # Expiration time (in seconds) of the IPs published by a shipper to the topology map.
  # All the IPs will be deleted afterwards. Note, that the value must be higher than
  # refresh_topology_freq. The default is 15 seconds.
  #topology_expire: 15

  # Internal queue size for single events in processing pipeline
  #queue_size: 1000

  # Configure local GeoIP database support.
  # If no paths are not configured geoip is disabled.
  #geoip:
    #paths:
    #  - "/usr/share/GeoIP/GeoLiteCity.dat"
    #  - "/usr/local/var/GeoIP/GeoLiteCity.dat"


############################# Logging #########################################

# There are three options for the log ouput: syslog, file, stderr.
# Under Windos systems, the log files are per default sent to the file output,
# under all other system per default to syslog.
logging:

  # Send all logging output to syslog. On Windows default is false, otherwise
  # default is true.
  #to_syslog: true

  # Write all logging output to files. Beats automatically rotate files if rotateeverybytes
  # limit is reached.
  #to_files: false

  # To enable logging to files, to_files option has to be set to true
  files:
    # The directory where the log files will written to.
    #path: /var/log/mybeat

    # The name of the files where the logs are written to.
    #name: mybeat

    # Configure log file size limit. If limit is reached, log file will be
    # automatically rotated
    rotateeverybytes: 10485760 # = 10MB

    # Number of rotated log files to keep. Oldest files will be deleted first.
    #keepfiles: 7

  # Enable debug output for selected components. To enable all selectors use ["*"]
  # Other available selectors are beat, publish, service
  # Multiple selectors can be chained.
  #selectors: [ ]

  # Sets log level. The default log level is error.
  # Available log levels are: critical, error, warning, info, debug
  #level: error
